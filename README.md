Project Summary:

This project is a simple RESTful API built using Node.js that mimics the functionality of [JSONPlaceholder's todos endpoint](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos). Instead of using a database, it utilizes the built-in `fs` (File System) module to read from and write to a `todos.json` file.
Additionally, the server implements an event-based logging system that records all API requests to a `logs.txt` file using the `events` module.

How to Install and Run:

git clone https://github.com/markjosephbsantos/appdev2-midterm-project.git

cd appdev2-midterm-project
